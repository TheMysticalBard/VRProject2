## Description with Screenshots
(Screenshot of the menu)
When the game is started, players are presented with a menu. There's a settings menu available from here as well as the start button.

(Screenshot of the settings)
The settings are simple, mainly just a volume slider.

(Screenshot of the starting location)
When players start, they are in a beautiful forested area looking towards the house where they will collect all of the items to attract the cats.

The cats all start in their own areas where they patrol around, waiting to be attracted to their different items.

(Screenshot of pause menu)
If the player presses escape on the keyboard, they pause the game and reach the pause menu. From there, they can access the main menu, resume the game, or get to the shop.

(Screenshot of the shop)
The shop is where the player can spend their goldfish to buy all the items to attract the cats. The player starts with 6 goldfish to spend however they want. Once they have purchased an item, it appears in the house and the cat that likes that item will move towards it.

Once the cat reaches the item, they add more goldfish to the player's wallet as a gift. The player can then use these to purchase more items in the house and collect all the cats.

And this is what the full house looks like!
