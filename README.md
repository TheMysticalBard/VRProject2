## Description with Screenshots
(Screenshot of the menu)
When the game is started, players are presented with a menu. There's a settings menu available from here as well as the start button.

(Screenshot of the settings)
The settings are simple, mainly just a volume slider.

(Screenshot of the starting location)
When players start, they are in a beautiful forested area looking towards the house where they will collect all of the items to attract the cats.

(Screenshot of all the cats)
The cats all start in their own areas where they patrol around, waiting to be attracted to their different items.

(Screenshot of pause menu)
If the player presses escape on the keyboard, they pause the game and reach the pause menu. From there, they can access the main menu, resume the game, or get to the shop.

(Screenshot of the shop)
The shop is where the player can spend their goldfish to buy all the items to attract the cats. The player starts with 6 goldfish to spend however they want. Once they have purchased an item, it appears in the house and the cat that likes that item will move towards it.

Once the cat reaches the item, they add more goldfish to the player's wallet as a gift. The player can then use these to purchase more items in the house and collect all the cats.

And this is what the full house looks like!

## Questions and Feedback from Professor & Classmates

Q: Are there any reasons that you focus on cat besides “I like cats”? Do you think it is going to be selective on the players?

A: Yes! Of course, part of the reason we chose a cat game is because we liked cats. However, the other reason we chose cats was because of their therapeutic and relaxing properties. This idea is outlined well in the paragraph that addresses the purring/haptic feedback idea.


Q: Where did you get the details on the store table and the cat table? Do you think the players going to learn and remember all of these details?

A: We made the table on our own. We discussed what kind of cats we wanted, their appearance, their personalities, and what items they would like. The players are not supposed to memorize the table, unless they want to. For the most part, encountering/collecting the cats should be a surprise! For example, you finally save up enough goldfish to buy something expensive from the store, like the fountain. When you buy the fountain, the cat Catara may appear because that’s one of the items she likes! If you’d never looked at the table before, you wouldn’t know that, so her appearance is a surprise! 


Q: Another question is: why does it need to be VR instead of a simple web game? Especially you don’t have a time limit for your game.

A: I think the best reason I could give for this is also outlined in the paragraph about purring/haptic feedback. Since cats are viewed as pets and comforting companions, it would feel even more relaxing to interact with a cat in VR rather than just on a screen. I think VR definitely makes the interaction with cats more immersive.


Q: How would the ongoing pandemic affect this type of game, especially if the playable locations API utilizes a public area.

A: Good question. While we do understand the importance of safety during the pandemic, the playable locations API functionality wouldn’t be a core functionality of the game. It would just be an add-on so that players could get more out of the game. If going into a public area were not prudent for the player, they would still be able to fully enjoy the game without using the playable locations API functionality. 


Q: How do you plan on implementing the gps feature? is it lubbock centered?

A: We planned on using Google’s Playable Locations API. We did plan on having it centered around Lubbock only, due to our lack of time/resources to expand it. If this were a wider scale project (and not just for class) we would definitely be looking to expand the range to include more cities!
